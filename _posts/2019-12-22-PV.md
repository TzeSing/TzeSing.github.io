## Calculating Present Value

- Money has *time value*
- A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow



In general, suppose that you will receive a cash flow of $C_t$ dollars at the end of year $t$.

The present value of this feature payment is 
$$
PV=\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$
the expression $\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$ is called the **discount factor**



## Calculating the Present Value of an Investment Opportunity

the rate of return $r$ is called the **discount rate, hurdle rate, opportunity cost of capital**.

It is an **opportunity cost** because it is the return that is foregone by investing in the project rather than investing in financial markets.
